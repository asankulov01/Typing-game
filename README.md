This is typing game that allows learn touch typing faster.
A simple game to test your typing skills. Built with pure Java.

Type the words as fast as you can, before they hit the button!

As programmers, we rely on many tools while coding. A keyboard is usually the most basic and most important of all such tools. Of course, there are far more important skills that a developer must have than typing speed. That being said, however, it's still great fun to hear the keys clicking away as you furiously write out some code. In fact, it's so fun, why not make it into a game? And a multiplayer one at that!

In the past, I've enjoyed typing games, but there is a large difference between typing natural language, and typing code (even the choice of programming language can make a significant difference!). I had found Typing.io a while back, which is great fun - but unfortunately doesn't support any kind of multiplayer.
